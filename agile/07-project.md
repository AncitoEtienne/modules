## Remember

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Good User Stories

Talk among your group and start capturing user stories for your project. This isn't just a hokey exerecise you have to do, so don't slack off or settle for bad user stories. This is really a conversation about what the final product will look like. Take each discrete story and put it on a notecard. Here is an example:

> **As a** student applying for jobs
>
> **I want** a website that looks good
>
> **So that** I can use it in my portfolio

Your group may or may not care about the look and feel of the site. You may say decide that you'll spend time doing original analysis, you'd prefer an ugly site with more code so that you can practice javascript.

> **As a** activist
>
> **I want** a website that tells a clear story
>
> **So that** I can use it to convince people about my cause

Or maybe your group has a lot of members working remotely.

> **As a** group that is working remotely
>
> **I want** a site with one discrete page and dataset per group member
>
> **So that** it is less difficult to coordinate if we're all working on separate pages.

## StoryTime Meeting

**Write User Stories**

1. Write good user stories. Its okay if they seem beyond the scope of what you think is possible in two one-week sprints. You may not ultimately get to some of these and that's alright. This is an exercise in understanding the users needs, and envisioning what the product could be. Remember, a story is not a contract, it is an invitation to a discussion.

**Organize and Refine User Stories**

1. Take the most important user stories and put them at the top of the stack, and the least important at the bottom.
2. Combine any that are basically the same and split any that are too large.
3. Select the 5 (approx) most important stories, and make sure they meet I-N-V-E-S-T and have a strong definition of done. Enter them into the top of a trello list called "USER STORIES".

## Sprint Planning Meeting


1. Create a new list in trello called BACKLOG. Take each user story and break it down into tasks, put those tasks in the backlog, prioritizing the most important at the top.

**Planning Poker**

1. Lets do one or two cards for a volunteer group with the whole class.
	1. Product owner presents a task
	2. Product owner solicits questions to make sure everyone is on the same page about what is included in that task and what is not.
	3. Poker commences
	4. Either agree on a consensus, or discuss further and do another round of poker.
2. Now lets turn it over to the groups to do that with the rest of the tasks.


## Daily Standup

**Moving Forward** - Count up the total number of points for the sprint. Every day during your group's daily scrum, please move cards around on the trello board as they're getting done. It will be the job of one person on the team to maintain a "burndown" of how many points the whole scrum is worth, and how many points you have accomplished so far. You will submit that as part of your final project. You should try to maintain a constant pace, or if you find you're not on track to finish, you may want to either adjust your pace or think about reducing the number of tasks, or negotiate a deadline extension.
