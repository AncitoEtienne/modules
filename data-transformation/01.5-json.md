# Data 1.5: JSON

Example JSON:
https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json

Another great Mozilla [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)

[Some insane diagrams](http://www.json.org/) that tell you exactly what is valid JSON.

[Validate JSON](http://pro.jsonlint.com/) by pasting into this tool (or many other "linters") online. They will display the data properly and tell you if its valid JSON or not. If it is not valid, you might have trouble reading it into a programming language.

There are also lots of [chrome extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/json?hl=en&_category=extensions) to help format json automatically when your browser encounters it. My favorite one (JsonView) apparently has a serious security vulnerability, so DO NOT download it, you can try any of the other ones here though. I've had success with this one  [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
