### Some charts from my stories

1. You can use color to highlight what you want the reader to focus on [2nd chart](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-the-cable-news-networks-are-covering-the-russia-story-just-not-the-same-one/). An annotation might be a good small modification to elect to make to your d3 graphic of choice. Another example might be [annotating an outlier](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-art-of-cherry-picking-polls/).
2. If there is something you have in mind, you might be able to google and find someone's example (you don't have to be limited to the examples I provided). For example, this is known as a [ternary plot](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-worst-tweeter-in-politics-isnt-trump/) and if you just google "ternary plot D3" you'll find some examples of plots just like it.
3. Hed and Dek [tell a story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mayweather-mcgregor-fight-as-told-through-emojis/). Sometimes its a good idea to have a chart that can also stand alone.
4. Putting different subsets of the data side by side in two charts can help you [compare and contrast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-media-really-has-neglected-puerto-rico/)
5. You don't have to visualize the whole dataset. One dataset can contain many stories. It might be easier to pick just one. [See Uber project](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/transportation/)
4. Label your axes (or at least mention the units of measurement in the text).
5. Cite your sources.
