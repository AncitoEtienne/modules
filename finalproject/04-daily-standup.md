## Daily Standup

During your daily standup meetings moving forward, you will keep your trello board open in view of all team members. You will discuss the following **in terms of trello cards**:

- What you did since the last meeting
	- (move a card from "doing" to "done")
- What you plan to do between now and the next meeting
	- (grab a card, assign it to whoever will be working on it, and move it to doing)
- Whether or not you have any blockers
	- (move a card to blocked) 

It will be the job of the scrum master to maintain a "burndown" of how many points the whole scrum is worth, and how many points you have accomplished so far each day. You can subtract the points for the card from your burndown when its moved to the "Done" column.

You will submit that as part of your final project. You should try to maintain a constant pace, or if you find you're not on track to finish, you may want to either adjust your pace or think about reducing the number of tasks, or negotiate a deadline extension.
