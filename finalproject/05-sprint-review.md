## Sprint Review

What it is: 

* Gather all stakeholders to demonstrate your accomplishment (working software!)
* Report which stories did and did not get completed and demonstrate the ones that did
* Reccommended Time: 0.5-1 hr for every week of development in the sprint
* Get feedback from stakeholders. Take notes on the stakeholder's reactions to the working software.

What it is not:

* A planning meeting - don't make promises about what you'll deliver when. You'll have a sprint planning meeting for that.


### Lets do it

1. I'll give you a few minutes to get yourselves organized. You'll need to show your 
	1. working software
	2. task-board 
	3. burndown chart

2. Lets do a Demo
	* Tell us each user story and demonstrate the working software for that user story.
	* The class will pretend to be a stakeholder and ask questions and give feedback. You should be taking notes on what the users and stakeholders have to say.
