## Remember

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Getting Started

- Before we start, assign a "product owner" and a "scrum master" in your group.
- Lets also take a second to brainstorm who the stakeholders are and make a notecard with each (team-member, professor, reader of your website)

### Setting up a Trello board

- Everyone in the group should make a trello account and sign in
- Have the product owner copy the board `T1-User-Stories`, but rename it to use your group number rather than T1 (so for example `A2-User-Stories`)

## StoryTime Meeting

**Part 1 - Write User Stories**

Talk among your group and start capturing user stories for your project. Its okay if they seem beyond the scope of what you think is possible in two one-week sprints. I anticipate you'll end up with something around 10 or so stories, maybe more. You may not ultimately get to some of these and that's alright. This is an exercise in understanding the users needs, and envisioning what the product could be. Remember, a story is not a contract, it is an invitation to a discussion. 

This isn't just a hokey exerecise you have to do, so don't slack off or settle for bad user stories. This is really a conversation about what the final product will look like. Take each discrete story and put it on a notecard. Here are some examples:

> **As a** design student applying for jobs
>
> **I want** a website that looks good
>
> **So that** I can use it in my portfolio

-- 
> **As a** reader
>
> **I want** a website that tells a clear story
>
> **So that** I can come away with a better understanding of climate change

--

> **As a** group that is working remotely
>
> **I want** a site with one discrete page and dataset per group member
>
> **So that** it is less difficult to coordinate if we're all working on separate pages.

-- 
> **As a** student who cares about my GPA
>
> **I want** to make sure the requirements for the project are met and documented
>
> **So that** nothing gets left out and we get a good grade in the class.
 
These should be **real** user-stories that help guide your  actual project, not hypothetical ones. They should define what you and your teammates hope to build, so be honest about who your users are. During this first stage your stories don't have to be super refined, we will think more about INVEST and the definitions of done in the next part.


**Part 2 - Organize and Refine User Stories**

1. As a team, organize your stories from smallest to largest.

2. Story Sizing
	* combine stories that are the same
	* remove stories that have no value
	* split stories that are too big and place each part back into the stack

3. Story Splitting - the "small" end of your list is where the stories you'll likely start on in Sprint 1 will be. If you have things that seem immediate but are on the "large" end, you may need to split those stories up.

	Remember, the stories should capture user needs. You don't have to make them too granular since stories will eventually get broken down into tasks.

4. Select the most immediate user stories (probably ones on the smaller end of your list at this point), and make sure they meet I-N-V-E-S-T and have a strong definition of done. Enter them into the top of a trello list called "USER STORIES".
	1. use a checklist to make sure they meet I-N-V-E-S-T
	2. add definition of done
	3. add acceptance criteria / definitions of done
